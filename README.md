CarsProject
CarsProject is a project focused on estimating prices of used cars listed on OLX. The project applies several machine learning models on the collected dataset to predict vehicle prices. In the future, we aim to implement deep learning techniques to train even more accurate models.

Additionally, CarsProject includes a web platform designed to make it easier for users to interact with the data and obtain price estimates.

Scraping Scripts
The data collection is performed via web scraping on OLX listings. The scraping logic is implemented in the following Python scripts:

carscrapy.py — scrapes car listings data

motoscrapy.py — scrapes motorcycle listings data

These scripts extract relevant vehicle information, clean and organize the data, and save it for further processing and model training.
